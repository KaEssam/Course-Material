# Assignment: Variables and Data Types

Complete the following exercises to practice what you've learned about JavaScript variables and data types.

## Exercise 1: Variable Declarations

Create variables for a user profile with the following requirements:

```javascript
// TODO: Declare these variables with appropriate types

// 1. User's first name (use let) - "Sarah"
// 2. User's last name (use let) - "Johnson"
// 3. User's age (use let) - 28
// 4. Maximum login attempts (use const) - 3
// 5. Is user currently online (use let) - true
// 6. User's email address (use let) - "sarah.johnson@email.com"
// 7. Account creation date (use const) - current date
// 8. User's role (use const) - "admin"
```

### Your Solution:
```javascript
// Write your variable declarations here
```

## Exercise 2: Data Type Identification

For each of the following values, identify the data type:

```javascript
let value1 = 42;
let value2 = "Hello World";
let value3 = true;
let value4 = null;
let value5 = undefined;
let value6 = { name: "John" };
let value7 = [1, 2, 3];
let value8 = 3.14159;
```

**Answer format:**
- `value1`: _____
- `value2`: _____
- `value3`: _____
- `value4`: _____
- `value5`: _____
- `value6`: _____
- `value7`: _____
- `value8`: _____

## Exercise 3: Variable Naming

Fix the following variable names to follow JavaScript naming conventions:

```javascript
// Fix these variable names:
let 2ndPlace = "Silver Medal";        // Issue: _____
let user-name = "alice123";           // Issue: _____
let total price = 99.99;              // Issue: _____
let class = "Mathematics";            // Issue: _____
let User_Email = "user@email.com";    // Issue: _____
```

### Your Fixed Version:
```javascript
// Write the corrected variable declarations here
```

## Exercise 4: Shopping Cart System

Create a simple shopping cart system using appropriate variable declarations:

```javascript
// TODO: Create variables for:

// 1. Cart items (array) - initially empty
// 2. Total price (number) - initially 0
// 3. Tax rate (constant) - 0.08 (8%)
// 4. Free shipping threshold (constant) - 50
// 5. Customer name (string) - "Jane Doe"
// 6. Is customer a premium member (boolean) - false
// 7. Discount percentage (number) - 0 (no discount initially)

// Then add some sample items to your cart and calculate totals
```

### Your Solution:
```javascript
// Write your shopping cart system here
```

## Exercise 5: Template Literals

Use template literals to create formatted strings:

```javascript
// Given these variables:
const firstName = "Alex";
const lastName = "Smith";
const age = 25;
const city = "Boston";
const temperature = 72;

// TODO: Create the following strings using template literals:

// 1. A greeting: "Hello, Alex Smith!"
// 2. User info: "Alex Smith is 25 years old and lives in Boston"
// 3. Weather update: "The current temperature in Boston is 72Â°F"
// 4. A multi-line user card:
//    Name: Alex Smith
//    Age: 25
//    Location: Boston
```

### Your Solution:
```javascript
// Write your template literal solutions here
```

## Exercise 6: Debugging

Find and fix the errors in this code:

```javascript
// Debug this code:
const userName = "john_doe";
userName = "jane_doe";                    // Error: _____

let user age = 30;                        // Error: _____
const 1stScore = 100;                     // Error: _____

let isActive = True;                      // Error: _____
const pi = 3.14159;
pi = 3.14;                               // Error: _____

let message = 'It's a beautiful day';     // Error: _____
```

### Your Fixed Version:
```javascript
// Write the corrected code here
```

## Bonus Challenge: Personal Information System

Create a comprehensive personal information system that demonstrates all the concepts from this lesson:

**Requirements:**
- Use all three variable declaration keywords appropriately
- Include at least 5 different data types
- Use template literals for formatted output
- Follow proper naming conventions
- Include at least one array and one object

### Your Challenge Solution:
```javascript
// Create your personal information system here
// Include comments explaining your choices
```

## Submission Guidelines

1. Complete all exercises above
2. Test your code to ensure it runs without errors
3. Add comments explaining your reasoning for variable declarations
4. Make sure to follow all naming conventions discussed in the lecture

## Self-Assessment

Rate your understanding of each topic (1-5 scale):

- [ ] Variable declaration with `let`, `const`, and `var`: ___/5
- [ ] Identifying data types: ___/5
- [ ] Naming conventions: ___/5
- [ ] Template literals: ___/5
- [ ] Best practices: ___/5

**Overall confidence level**: ___/5

### Reflection Questions:
1. What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
2. Which variable declaration keyword do you think you'll use most often and why?
3. How do proper variable names improve code readability?
