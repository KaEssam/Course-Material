# React Components: Building Blocks of UI

React is built around the concept of **components** - reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces.

## What is a Component?

A component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX to describe what should appear on the screen.

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

## Functional Components

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>
      <p>Let's build something awesome.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Props: Passing Data

Props allow you to pass data from parent to child components:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Alice" />
      <Greeting name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Summary

React components enable building reusable, modular UIs through composition and props.
