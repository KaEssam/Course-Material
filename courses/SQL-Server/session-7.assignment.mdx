1.Create a non-clustered index on the `email` column in the `sales.customers` table to improve search performance when looking up customers by email.

2.Create a composite index on the `production.products` table that includes `category_id` and `brand_id` columns to optimize searches that filter by both category and brand.

3.Create an index on `sales.orders` table for the `order_date` column and include `customer_id`, `store_id`, and `order_status` as included columns to improve reporting queries.

4.Create a trigger that automatically inserts a welcome record into a `customer_log` table whenever a new customer is added to `sales.customers`. (First create the log table, then the trigger)

5.Create a trigger on `production.products` that logs any changes to the `list_price` column into a `price_history` table, storing the old price, new price, and change date.

6.Create an INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger on `production.categories` that prevents deletion of categories that have associated products. Display an appropriate error message.

7.Create a trigger on `sales.order_items` that automatically reduces the quantity in `production.stocks` when a new order item is inserted.

8.Create a trigger that logs all new orders into an `order_audit` table, capturing order details and the date/time when the record was created.

### Required Tables for Trigger Questions

Before starting the trigger questions, create these additional tables:

```sql
-- Customer activity log
CREATE TABLE sales.customer_log (
    log_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    action VARCHAR(50),
    log_date DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Price history tracking
CREATE TABLE production.price_history (
    history_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    old_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    new_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    change_date DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    changed_by VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Order audit trail
CREATE TABLE sales.order_audit (
    audit_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    store_id INT,
    staff_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    audit_timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```
