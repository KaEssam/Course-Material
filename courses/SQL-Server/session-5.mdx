## **1. CASE WHEN Statement**

### Overview

The `CASE WHEN` statement allows you to perform if-then-else operations within queries. It evaluates conditions sequentially and returns the first matching result.

**What it does:** Provides conditional logic to transform data based on specified criteria.

### Syntax

```sql
-- Simple CASE
CASE column_name
    WHEN value1 THEN result1
    WHEN value2 THEN result2
    ELSE default_result
END
```

### Purpose and Benefits
- **Why use it:** Transform data during retrieval without modifying the original table
- **Problems it solves:**
  - Categorizing data (e.g., age groups, salary ranges)
  - Creating readable reports with descriptive labels
  - Conditional calculations
- **Advantages:** Performs logic at the database level, reducing application complexity

### Example with StoreDB

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    list_price,
    CASE
        WHEN list_price < 500 THEN 'Budget'
        WHEN list_price BETWEEN 500 AND 1500 THEN 'Mid-Range'
        ELSE 'Premium'
    END AS price_category
FROM production.products
ORDER BY list_price;
```

## **2. Handling NULLs (COALESCE, ISNULL, NULLIF)**

### Overview

NULL values can break calculations and comparisons. These functions offer safe handling of NULLs in expressions and outputs.

### Functions:

- `COALESCE`: Returns the first non-NULL value
- `ISNULL`: Replaces NULL with a specified value
- `NULLIF`: Returns NULL if two expressions are equal

### Purpose and Benefits
- **Why use them:** Handle NULL values gracefully without complex conditional logic
- **Problems they solve:**
  - Providing default values for NULL columns
  - Combining multiple nullable columns
  - Data cleansing and standardization
- **Advantages:** More readable than nested CASE statements, ANSI standard (COALESCE is portable)

### Examples with StoreDB

#### COALESCE Function
```sql
-- COALESCE(expression1, expression2, default)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    first_name + ' ' + last_name AS customer_name,
    phone,
    email,
    COALESCE(phone, email, 'No Contact Info') AS best_contact_method
FROM sales.customers
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

#### ISNULL Function
```sql
-- ISNULL
SELECT
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    ISNULL(phone, 'No Phone Available') AS contact_phone
FROM sales.customers
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

## **3. Common Table Expressions (CTE)**

### Overview

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary named result set that exists within the scope of a single SQL statement. It's defined using the `WITH` clause and can be referenced multiple times in the main query.

**What it does:** Creates a temporary, named query result that can be used like a table within the main query.

### Syntax
```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...) AS (
    -- CTE query definition
    SELECT ...
)
-- Main query using the CTE
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

### Purpose and Benefits
- **Why use it:** Improve query readability, avoid repetitive subqueries, enable recursive operations
- **Problems it solves:**
  - Complex nested queries become more readable
  - Recursive operations (organizational charts, bill of materials)
  - Intermediate result sets for complex calculations
- **Advantages:** Better readability than subqueries, can be referenced multiple times, supports recursion
- **Performance:** CTEs are not materialized (calculated each time referenced)

### Example with StoreDB

```sql
WITH expensive_products AS (
    SELECT
        product_name,
        list_price,
        brand_id
    FROM production.products
    WHERE list_price > 1000
)
SELECT
    ep.product_name,
    b.brand_name,
    ep.list_price
FROM expensive_products ep
JOIN production.brands b ON ep.brand_id = b.brand_id
ORDER BY ep.list_price DESC;
```

## **4. Ranking Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, NTILE)**

### Overview

These are window functions that assign ranking values to rows in a result set. They differ in how they handle ties (duplicate values).

**What they do:**
- **ROW_NUMBER():** Assigns unique sequential numbers (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- **RANK():** Assigns ranks with gaps after ties (1, 2, 2, 4...)
- **DENSE_RANK():** Assigns ranks without gaps after ties (1, 2, 2, 3...)
- **NTILE(n):** Divides rows into `n` buckets and assigns a bucket number (1 to n)

### Syntax
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column)
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column)
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column)
NTILE(n) OVER (ORDER BY column)
```

### Purpose and Benefits
- **Why use them:** Assign rankings, create numbered lists, handle pagination
- **Problems they solve:**
  - Creating leaderboards
  - Pagination in applications
  - Identifying top/bottom performers
- **Advantages:** Efficient ranking at database level, handles ties appropriately

**ROW_NUMBER():**
```sql
SELECT
  product_id,
  product_name,
  list_price,
  DENSE_RANK () OVER (
    ORDER BY list_price DESC
  ) price_rank

FROM
  production.products;
```

**RANK():**
```sql
SELECT
  product_id,
  product_name,
  list_price,
  RANK () OVER (
    ORDER BY list_price DESC
  ) price_rank
FROM
  production.products;
```

**ROW_NUMBER():**

```sql
SELECT
   ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  ORDER BY first_name
   ) row_num,
   first_name,
   last_name,
   city
FROM
   sales.customers;
```

**NTILE(n):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales.ntile (
  v INT NOT NULL

);


INSERT INTO sales.ntile(v)
VALUES(1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10);

SELECT * FROM sales.ntile;

--

SELECT
	v,
	NTILE (3) OVER (
		ORDER BY v
	) buckets
FROM
	sales.ntile_demo;


```


**Example Showing All Four:**
```sql
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    c.category_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) AS total_revenue,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) DESC) AS row_num,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) DESC) AS rank_pos,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) DESC) AS dense_rank_pos,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) DESC) AS quartile
FROM production.products p
JOIN sales.order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN production.categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, c.category_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```


### Comparison Table

| Function     | Handles Ties       | Gaps After Ties | Use Case                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ROW_NUMBER() | No (always unique) | N/A             | Pagination, unique identifiers              |
| RANK()       | Yes                | Yes             | Traditional ranking (Olympic medals)        |
| DENSE_RANK() | Yes                | No              | Continuous ranking (grade levels)           |
| NTILE(n)     | No                 | N/A             | Dividing into n groups (quartiles, deciles) |

## **5. PIVOT**

### Overview

`PIVOT` transforms rows into columns, to restructure rows into columns for reporting and comparison.

### Syntax
```sql
-- PIVOT
SELECT ...
FROM (source_query) AS source_table
PIVOT (
    aggregate_function(value_column)
    FOR pivot_column IN ([value1], [value2], [value3])
) AS pivot_table;
```

### Purpose and Benefits
- **Why use them:** Reshape data for reporting, create crosstab reports, normalize/denormalize data
- **Problems they solve:**
  - Creating summary reports with categories as columns
  - Converting wide tables to long format for analysis
  - Preparing data for specific reporting tools
- **Advantages:** Efficient data transformation at database level

### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM

(
    SELECT
        category_name,
        product_id
    FROM
        production.products p
        INNER JOIN production.categories c
            ON c.category_id = p.category_id
) t
PIVOT(
    COUNT(product_id)
    FOR category_name IN (
        [Children Bicycles],
        [Comfort Bicycles],
        [Cruisers Bicycles],
        [Cyclocross Bicycles],
        [Electric Bikes],
        [Mountain Bikes],
        [Road Bikes])
) AS pivot_table;
```

## **6. Set Operators (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)**

### Overview

Set operators are used to combine results from multiple SELECT statements.

**What they do:**

- **UNION:** Combines results from multiple queries, removing duplicates
- **UNION ALL:** Combines results from multiple queries, keeping all duplicates
- **INTERSECT:** Returns only rows that exist in both result sets
- **EXCEPT:** Returns rows from the first query that don't exist in the second query

### Syntax

```sql
-- UNION (removes duplicates)
SELECT columns FROM table1
UNION
SELECT columns FROM table2;

-- UNION ALL (keeps duplicates)
SELECT columns FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT columns FROM table2;

-- INTERSECT (common rows)
SELECT columns FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT columns FROM table2;

-- EXCEPT (difference)
SELECT columns FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT columns FROM table2;
```

### Purpose and Benefits

- **Why use them:** Combine data from multiple sources, perform set-based operations, create comprehensive reports
- **Problems they solve:**
  - Merging data from similar tables
  - Finding common or unique records
  - Creating unified views of disparate data
  - Data comparison and analysis
- **Advantages:** Powerful set-based operations, clean syntax, efficient for large datasets

### Examples

**UNION:**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM sales.staffs
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM sales.customers;
```


**INTERSECT:**

```sql
SELECT city FROM sales.customers
INTERSECT
SELECT city FROMsales.stores
ORDER BYcity;`
```



**EXCEPT:**

```sql
SELECT product_id FROM production.products
EXCEPT
SELECT product_id FROM sales.order_items;
```

### Set Operator Comparison

| Operator      | Description                          | Duplicates | Use Case               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| **UNION**     | Combines results, removes duplicates | Removed    | Merging unique records |
| **UNION ALL** | Combines results, keeps duplicates   | Kept       | Merging all records    |
| **INTERSECT** | Returns common rows only             | Removed    | Finding overlap        |
| **EXCEPT**    | Returns rows in first but not second | Removed    | Finding differences    |

### When to Use Each Operator:

**Use UNION when:**
- Combining data from similar tables
- Creating comprehensive views
- You need to remove duplicates
- Merging historical and current data

**Use UNION ALL when:**
- You want to keep all records including duplicates
- Performance is critical
- You're sure there are no duplicates
- You need to count total occurrences

**Use INTERSECT when:**
- Finding common records between datasets
- Identifying overlap in data
- Data validation between systems
- Finding customers in multiple segments

**Use EXCEPT when:**
- Finding records that exist in one set but not another
- Identifying missing data
- Data quality analysis
- Finding inactive or churned customers
