### Task 1: ER Diagram Design

Create a complete Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- The company has a number of employees; each employee has SSN, Birth Date, Gender and Name which represented as Fname and Lname.
- The company has a set of departments; each department has a set of attributes DName, DNUM (unique) and locations.
- Employees work in several projects; each project has Pname, PNumber as an identifier, Location City.
- Each employee may have a set of dependents; each dependent has Dependent Name (unique), Gender and Birthdate. Note: if the employee left the company no needs to store his dependents info.
- For each Department, there is always one employee assigned to manage that Department and each manager has a hiring Date.
- Department may have employees but employee must work on Only One department.
- Each department may have a set of projects and each project must assigned to one department.
- Employees work in several projects and each project has several employees and each employee has a number of working hours in each project.
- Each employee has a supervisor.

### Task 2: Relational Schema Mapping

Convert your ER diagram to relational schema using the mapping rules

Provide the complete relational schema with:

- Table names and column names
- Primary keys (PK)
- Foreign keys (FK)
- Data types for each column
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.)

### Task 3: SQL Implementation

Implement the following SQL statements:

- Create the EMPLOYEE table with all constraints
- Create the DEPARTMENT table with proper relationships
- Create the PROJECT table
- Add foreign key constraints between tables
- Insert sample data into EMPLOYEE table (at least 5 employees)
- Insert sample data into DEPARTMENT table (at least 3 departments)
- Update an employee's department
- Delete a dependent record
- Retrieve all employees working in a specific department
- Find all employees and their project assignments with working hours

---

### Additional Notes

- Use proper SQL Server syntax for all queries
- Include sample data that demonstrates all relationships
- Test your queries to ensure they work correctly
- Consider performance implications in your design
- Document any assumptions you make about the requirements
