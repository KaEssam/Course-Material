## **1. Aggregate Functions**

### Overview

Aggregate functions produce a single summarized value from a group of rows. They are essential for generating totals, averages, counts, or identifying extremes in datasets. The `GROUP BY` clause organizes rows into subsets based on one or more columns, enabling calculations per group. The `HAVING` clause filters those groups based on the results of aggregate computations, functioning like a `WHERE` clause at the group level.

### Use Cases:

- Calculate total sales by region
- Determine average purchase amount per customer segment
- Analyze monthly inventory levels per product category

### Common Aggregate Functions

| Function | Description                          | Example                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| COUNT()  | Counts rows or non-null values       | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;`         |
| SUM()    | Computes the sum of a numeric column | `SELECT SUM(list_price) FROM products;`  |
| AVG()    | Returns the average value            | `SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM order_items;` |
| MAX()    | Identifies the largest value         | `SELECT MAX(price) FROM products;`       |
| MIN()    | Identifies the smallest value        | `SELECT MIN(price) FROM products;`       |


### `COUNT()` - How many records do we have?

```sql
-- Count all products
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_products
FROM production.products;
```

```sql
-- Count customers who have phone numbers (excludes NULLs)
SELECT COUNT(phone) as customers_with_phone
FROM sales.customers;
```

### `SUM()` - Add up numeric values

```sql
-- What's our total inventory value?
SELECT SUM(list_price) as total_inventory_value
FROM production.products;
```

```sql
-- Total revenue from completed orders
SELECT SUM(quantity * list_price * (1 - discount)) as total_revenue
FROM sales.order_items oi
INNER JOIN sales.orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.order_status = 4;
```

### `AVG()` - Find the average

```sql
-- What's the average product price?
SELECT AVG(list_price) as average_price
FROM production.products;
```

```sql
-- Average quantity per order item
SELECT AVG(quantity) as avg_quantity
FROM sales.order_items;
```

### `MAX()`/`MIN()` - Find extremes

```sql
-- Most expensive and cheapest products
SELECT
    MAX(list_price) as highest_price,
    MIN(list_price) as lowest_price,
    MAX(list_price) - MIN(list_price) as price_range
FROM production.products;
```

## **2. Built-in Functions**

### Overview

Built-in functions process string, numeric, and date/time values on a row-by-row basis. These tools are key to data preprocessing, transformation, and formatting.

### Use Cases:

- Clean and standardize inconsistent input
- Derive new calculated columns
- Format data for presentation or export

### String Functions

| Function        | Description                            | Example                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| LEN()           | Returns string length                  | `LEN(first_name)`                |
| UPPER()/LOWER() | Changes case of characters             | `UPPER(email)`                   |
| LEFT()/RIGHT()  | Extracts characters from a string      | `LEFT(phone, 3)`                 |
| REPLACE()       | Substitutes one substring with another | `REPLACE(email, '.com', '.net')` |

#### Example

```sql
-- Basic string operations
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    LEN(first_name) as name_length,
    UPPER(first_name) as name_upper,
    LOWER(last_name) as last_name_lower,
    LEFT(first_name, 1) as first_initial,
    first_name + ' ' + last_name as full_name
FROM sales.customers
WHERE customer_id <= 10;
```

```sql
-- Phone number formatting
SELECT
    customer_id,
    phone,
    LEFT(phone, 3) as area_code,
    RIGHT(phone, 4) as last_four,
    '(' + LEFT(phone, 3) + ') ' + SUBSTRING(phone, 4, 3) + '-' + RIGHT(phone, 4) as formatted_phone
FROM sales.customers
WHERE phone IS NOT NULL AND customer_id <= 10;
```

### Numeric Functions

| Function          | Description                          | Example                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| ROUND()           | Rounds numbers to specified decimals | `ROUND(price, 2)`            |
| ABS()             | Returns absolute value               | `ABS(-5)`                    |
| CEILING()/FLOOR() | Rounds up/down to nearest integer    | `CEILING(4.3)`, `FLOOR(4.9)` |

```sql
-- Basic numeric operations
SELECT
    product_name,
    list_price,
    ROUND(list_price, 0) as rounded_price,
    CEILING(list_price) as price_ceiling,
    FLOOR(list_price) as price_floor,
    ABS(list_price - 100) as difference_from_100
FROM production.products
WHERE product_id <= 10;
```

```sql
-- Price calculations
SELECT
    product_name,
    list_price,
    list_price * 0.1 as ten_percent_discount,
    ROUND(list_price * 0.9, 2) as sale_price
FROM production.products
WHERE product_id <= 10;
```

### Date Functions

| Function       | Description                       | Example                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| GETDATE()      | Returns current system date/time  | `SELECT GETDATE()`            |
| YEAR()/MONTH() | Extracts year/month from date     | `YEAR(order_date)`            |
| DATEDIFF()     | Calculates interval between dates | `DATEDIFF(DAY, start, end)`   |
| DATEADD()      | Adds interval to a date           | `DATEADD(DAY, 7, order_date)` |

#### Example

```sql
-- Basic date operations
SELECT
    order_id,
    order_date,
    GETDATE() as current_date,
    YEAR(order_date) as order_year,
    MONTH(order_date) as order_month,
    DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) as month_name,
    DATENAME(WEEKDAY, order_date) as weekday_name
FROM sales.orders
WHERE order_id <= 10;
```

```sql
-- Date calculations
SELECT
    order_id,
    order_date,
    shipped_date,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, order_date, shipped_date) as processing_days,
    DATEADD(DAY, 30, order_date) as return_deadline
FROM sales.orders
WHERE shipped_date IS NOT NULL AND order_id <= 10;
```

## 3. Joins

### Overview

Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables by linking related fields. They are essential in normalized databases where data is logically split across entities.

### Use Cases

- Combine transactional and reference data
- Enrich records with external information
- Perform analytics across interconnected tables

## Join Types

### INNER JOIN

> Returns only matching rows


```SQL
-- Products with assigned brands
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    c.category_name,
    p.list_price
FROM production.products p
INNER JOIN production.categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
```

![INNER JOIN](/images/sql-joins/INNER%20JOIN.avif)

### LEFT JOIN

> All rows from the left table + matched rows

```SQL
-- All products, even if they haven't sold
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    b.brand_name,
    COUNT(oi.order_id) as times_sold
FROM production.products p
INNER JOIN production.brands b ON p.brand_id = b.brand_id
LEFT JOIN sales.order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, b.brand_name
ORDER BY times_sold DESC;
```

![LEFT JOIN](/images/sql-joins/LEFT%20JOIN.avif)

### RIGHT JOIN

> All rows from the right table + matched rows

```SQL
-- All orders, even those without product records
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    p.product_name,
    oi.quantity
FROM production.products p
RIGHT JOIN sales.order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
INNER JOIN sales.orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
```

![RIGHT JOIN](/images/sql-joins/RIGHT%20JOIN.avif)

### FULL OUTER JOIN

> All rows from both tables

```SQL
-- Combined datasets with or without matches
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    s.quantity as stock_quantity
FROM production.products p
FULL OUTER JOIN production.stocks s ON p.product_id = s.product_id AND s.store_id = 1
```

![FULL OUTER JOIN](/images/sql-joins/FULL%20OUTER%20JOIN.avif)

### Self JOIN

> A table joined to itself


```SQL
-- Employees and their managers in the same table

SELECT
    e.first_name + ' ' + e.last_name as employee_name,
    m.first_name + ' ' + m.last_name as manager_name
FROM sales.staffs e
LEFT JOIN sales.staffs m ON e.manager_id = m.staff_id
WHERE e.staff_id <= 20
ORDER BY e.staff_id;
```


### Special Function: `COALESCE()`

 #### What It Does:

> `COALESCE()` returns the first non-null value from a list of expressions. It's useful > when dealing with nullable fields and ensuring fallback values are displayed.

 #### Syntax

COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN)

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       COALESCE(email, phone, 'No contact info') AS contact
FROM customers;
```
This query returns the email if it exists, otherwise the phone, and if both are null, it shows 'No contact info'.

  Use Cases
 - Filling missing data with default values
 - Choosing the first available data source
 - Avoiding null in reports or exports
 - Monthly departmental expense tracking
 - Product performance summaries
 - Course score distributions

```sql
-- Staff and their managers
SELECT
    e.first_name + ' ' + e.last_name as employee_name,
    COALESCE(m.first_name + ' ' + m.last_name, 'No Manager') as manager_name
FROM sales.staffs e
LEFT JOIN sales.staffs m ON e.manager_id = m.staff_id
ORDER BY e.staff_id;
```

![Self Join](/images/sql-joins/Self%20Join.avif)

### Cross JOIN

> Every combination of rows from both tables

```SQL
--  Matrix-like pairing of regions and products
SELECT
    b.brand_name,
    c.category_name
FROM production.brands b
CROSS JOIN production.categories c
WHERE b.brand_id <= 5 AND c.category_id <= 5
ORDER BY b.brand_name, c.category_name;
```

![CROSS JOIN](/images/sql-joins/CROSS%20JOIN.avif)

### Examples with aggregate functions

```sql
-- Orders by each store
SELECT
    s.store_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders
FROM sales.stores s
LEFT JOIN sales.orders o ON s.store_id = o.store_id
GROUP BY s.store_id, s.store_name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```

```sql
-- Products by category
SELECT
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(p.product_id) as product_count,
    AVG(p.list_price) as avg_price
FROM production.categories c
LEFT JOIN production.products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name;

```

```sql
-- Staff with more than 10 orders
SELECT
    st.first_name + ' ' + st.last_name as staff_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders
FROM sales.staffs st
INNER JOIN sales.orders o ON st.staff_id = o.staff_id
GROUP BY st.staff_id, st.first_name, st.last_name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > 10
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

```

```sql
-- Categories with average price above $100
SELECT
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(p.product_id) as product_count,
    AVG(p.list_price) as avg_price
FROM production.categories c
INNER JOIN production.products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name
HAVING AVG(p.list_price) > 100
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;

```

## 4. Subqueries

### Conceptual Overview

Subqueries are nested queries used within SELECT, WHERE, or FROM clauses. They are powerful tools for isolating logic, performing comparisons, or generating derived columns.

### Use Cases

- Perform calculations based on results of another query
- Filter records using external conditions
- Break down complex logic into manageable components

### Subquery Contexts

| Clause | Purpose                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| SELECT | Return computed column                |
| WHERE  | Condition based on another result set |
| FROM   | Create inline views or derived tables |

### Examples

```sql
-- Products above average price
SELECT product_name, list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price > (
  SELECT AVG(list_price) FROM production.products
);
```

```sql
-- Customers who placed orders
SELECT *
FROM sales.customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id FROM sales.orders
);
```

### subquery in WHERE clause

```sql
-- Find products more expensive than average
SELECT
    product_name,
    list_price,
    (SELECT AVG(list_price) FROM production.products) as average_price
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price > (SELECT AVG(list_price) FROM production.products)
ORDER BY list_price DESC;
```

### Subquery with IN

```sql
-- Customers who have placed orders
SELECT
    first_name + ' ' + last_name as customer_name,
    email
FROM sales.customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM sales.orders WHERE order_status = 4
)
ORDER BY customer_name;
```

### Subquery in SELECT clause

```sql
SELECT
    c.first_name + ' ' + c.last_name as customer_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales.orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id) as order_count
FROM sales.customers c
WHERE c.customer_id <= 10
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### Pros & Cons
#### ✅ Benefits

- Enhances filtering and dynamic logic
- Allows modular query design
- Useful in business rule implementation

#### ❌ Drawbacks

- Performance overhead on large datasets
- Can be harder to debug or optimize

## 5. Views

### Conceptual Overview

A view is a virtual table based on a stored SELECT query. Views simplify access to complex logic, standardize analytics, and restrict access to sensitive data.

### Use Cases

- Create reusable reporting structures
- Abstract complex joins or filters
- Expose only necessary data to users

### Example

```sql
CREATE VIEW product_summary AS
SELECT
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(p.product_id) AS total_products,
    AVG(p.list_price) as avg_price,
    MIN(p.list_price) as min_price,
    MAX(p.list_price) as max_price
FROM production.products p
INNER JOIN production.categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name;

-- Use the view
SELECT * FROM product_summary
WHERE avg_price > 100
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
```

```sql
-- Simple view for customer summary
CREATE VIEW customer_summary AS
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name + ' ' + c.last_name as customer_name,
    c.email,
    c.city,
    c.state
FROM sales.customers c;

-- Use the view
SELECT * FROM customer_summary
WHERE state = 'CA'
ORDER BY customer_name;
```

```sql
-- View with calculations
CREATE VIEW order_totals AS
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.customer_id,
    o.order_date,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) as order_total
FROM sales.orders o
INNER JOIN sales.order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.order_status = 4
GROUP BY o.order_id, o.customer_id, o.order_date;
```
###

#### ✅ Benefits

- Promotes code reuse and abstraction
- Supports role-based access
- Improves query clarity and modularity

#### ❌ Limitations

- Limited write support
- Can incur performance costs on complex queries
