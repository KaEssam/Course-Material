1.Write a query that classifies all products into price categories:
- Products under $300: "Economy"
- Products $300-$999: "Standard"
- Products $1000-$2499: "Premium"
- Products $2500 and above: "Luxury"

2.Create a query that shows order processing information with user-friendly status descriptions:
- Status 1: "Order Received"
- Status 2: "In Preparation"
- Status 3: "Order Cancelled"
- Status 4: "Order Delivered"

Also add a priority level:
- Orders with status 1 older than 5 days: "URGENT"
- Orders with status 2 older than 3 days: "HIGH"
- All other orders: "NORMAL"

3.Write a query that categorizes staff based on the number of orders they've handled:
- 0 orders: "New Staff"
- 1-10 orders: "Junior Staff"
- 11-25 orders: "Senior Staff"
- 26+ orders: "Expert Staff"

4.Create a query that handles missing customer contact information:
- Use ISNULL to replace missing phone numbers with "Phone Not Available"
- Use COALESCE to create a preferred_contact field (phone first, then email, then "No Contact Method")
- Show complete customer information

5.Write a query that safely calculates price per unit in stock:
- Use NULLIF to prevent division by zero when quantity is 0
- Use ISNULL to show 0 when no stock exists
- Include stock status using CASE WHEN
- Only show products from store_id = 1

6.Create a query that formats complete addresses safely:
- Use COALESCE for each address component
- Create a formatted_address field that combines all components
- Handle missing ZIP codes gracefully

7.Use a CTE to find customers who have spent more than $1,500 total:
- Create a CTE that calculates total spending per customer
- Join with customer information
- Show customer details and spending
- Order by total_spent descending

8.Create a multi-CTE query for category analysis:
- CTE 1: Calculate total revenue per category
- CTE 2: Calculate average order value per category
- Main query: Combine both CTEs
- Use CASE to rate performance: >$50000 = "Excellent", >$20000 = "Good", else = "Needs Improvement"

9.Use CTEs to analyze monthly sales trends:
- CTE 1: Calculate monthly sales totals
- CTE 2: Add previous month comparison
- Show growth percentage

10.Create a query that ranks products within each category:
- Use ROW_NUMBER() to rank by price (highest first)
- Use RANK() to handle ties
- Use DENSE_RANK() for continuous ranking
- Only show top 3 products per category

11.Rank customers by their total spending:
- Calculate total spending per customer
- Use RANK() for customer ranking
- Use NTILE(5) to divide into 5 spending groups
- Use CASE for tiers: 1="VIP", 2="Gold", 3="Silver", 4="Bronze", 5="Standard"

12.Create a comprehensive store performance ranking:
- Rank stores by total revenue
- Rank stores by number of orders
- Use PERCENT_RANK() to show percentile performance

13.Create a PIVOT table showing product counts by category and brand:
- Rows: Categories
- Columns: Top 4 brands (Electra, Haro, Trek, Surly)
- Values: Count of products

14.Create a PIVOT showing monthly sales revenue by store:
- Rows: Store names
- Columns: Months (Jan through Dec)
- Values: Total revenue
- Add a total column

15.PIVOT order statuses across stores:
- Rows: Store names
- Columns: Order statuses (Pending, Processing, Completed, Rejected)
- Values: Count of orders

16.Create a PIVOT comparing sales across years:
- Rows: Brand names
- Columns: Years (2016, 2017, 2018)
- Values: Total revenue
- Include percentage growth calculations

17.Use UNION to combine different product availability statuses:
- Query 1: In-stock products (quantity > 0)
- Query 2: Out-of-stock products (quantity = 0 or NULL)
- Query 3: Discontinued products (not in stocks table)

18.Use INTERSECT to find loyal customers:
- Find customers who bought in both 2017 AND 2018
- Show their purchase patterns

19.Use multiple set operators to analyze product distribution:
- INTERSECT: Products available in all 3 stores
- EXCEPT: Products available in store 1 but not in store 2
- UNION: Combine above results with different labels

20.Complex set operations for customer retention:
- Find customers who bought in 2016 but not in 2017 (lost customers)
- Find customers who bought in 2017 but not in 2016 (new customers)
- Find customers who bought in both years (retained customers)
- Use UNION ALL to combine all three groups
