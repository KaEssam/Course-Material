### Summary

| System Type | Best For                               | Limitations                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| File-Based  | Simple storage and legacy systems      | No integrity, security, or advanced features     |
| SQL         | Business apps needing strong structure | More setup, cost, and technical knowledge needed |
| NoSQL       | Scalable, fast, flexible systems       | Less strict data validation, varied tools        |

### Notes

- NoSQL is not a replacement for SQL — it's a different approach for different use cases.
- SQL is still dominant in many enterprise environments due to its structure and maturity.
- Choosing between them depends on **use case**, **data structure**, **scalability needs**, and **team expertise**.

## Database Fundamentals

### What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It is managed by a Database Management System (DBMS), which provides:

- **Data Storage**: Efficient storage and organization of large amounts of data
- **Data Retrieval**: Quick access to specific information
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data
- **Data Security**: Controls access and protects sensitive information
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple users can access data simultaneously

### Why Use Databases?

- **Eliminate Data Redundancy**: Avoid duplicate data storage
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure all data is accurate and up-to-date
- **Data Sharing**: Multiple applications can access the same data
- **Data Security**: Implement access controls and encryption
- **Backup and Recovery**: Protect against data loss

---

## Database Design Life Cycle

### 1. Requirements Gathering

- **Identify stakeholders** and their data needs
- **Document business rules** and constraints
- **Define functional requirements** (what the system should do)
- **Determine non-functional requirements** (performance, security)

### 2. DBMS Selection

- **Evaluate different database systems** (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)
- **Consider scalability, cost, and licensing**
- **Assess technical requirements** and compatibility

### 3. Analysis

- **Create conceptual models** using ER diagrams
- **Identify entities, attributes, and relationships**
- **Validate requirements** with stakeholders

### 4. Logical Design

- **Convert ER model to relational schema**
- **Define tables, columns, and relationships**
- **Apply normalization principles**

### 5. Physical Design

- **Optimize for performance** (indexes, partitioning)
- **Define storage structures**
- **Plan for security implementation**

### 6. Creation

- **Implement the database schema**
- **Create tables, views, and stored procedures**
- **Set up security and access controls**

## Entity-Relationship Modeling

### What is ER Modeling?

Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling is a conceptual design technique used to model data requirements of an information system. It provides a visual representation of entities, their attributes, and relationships between them.

![ER Modeling Overview](/images/database-design/266859859-7e7f11b7-8da4-401e-b84b-8ef610ebcf5f.png)

### Importance and Benefits

- **Visual Communication**: Easy to understand and communicate with stakeholders
- **Design Validation**: Helps identify missing requirements early
- **Documentation**: Serves as comprehensive system documentation
- **Implementation Guide**: Provides blueprint for database creation
- **Maintenance**: Facilitates future modifications and updates

> **Tip**: ER diagrams are like architectural blueprints for databases - they show the structure before building begins.

## Components of ER Modeling

### 1. Entities

An entity is a real-world object or concept.

**Strong Entities**: Can exist independently

- Student, Course, Department

**Weak Entities**: Cannot exist without another entity

- Dependent (requires Employee), Room (requires Building)

![Entity Types](/images/database-design/Entities.drawio.png)

### 2. Attributes

Properties that describe entities.

### **Simple Attributes**: Cannot be divided further

- Name, Age, Email

![Simple Attributes](/images/database-design/Simple%20Attributes.drawio.png)

### **Composite Attributes**: Can be broken into smaller parts

- Address (Street, City, State, ZIP)

![Composite Attributes](/images/database-design/composite%20attributes.drawio.png)

### **Derived Attributes**: Calculated from other attributes

- Age (derived from birth_date)

![Derived Attributes](/images/database-design/Drived%20Attributes.drawio.png)

### **Multivalued Attributes**: Can have multiple values

- Phone numbers

![Multivalued Attributes](/images/database-design/multivalued%20attributes.drawio.png)

### **Complex Attributes**: Composite + multivalued (have more address and address is composite)

![Complex Attributes](/images/database-design/Complix%20Attributes.drawio.png)

### 3. Relationships

Associations between two or more entities.

### **1. Unary (Degree = 1)**: Between two instances of one entity type

![Unary Relationship](/images/database-design/unary%20.drawio.png)

### **2. Binary (Degree = 2)**: Between two instances of two entity types

![Binary Relationship](/images/database-design/binary%20.drawio.png)

### **3. Ternary (Degree = 3)**: Among the instances of three entity types

![Ternary Relationship](/images/database-design/Ternary%20.drawio.png)

### Cardinality of Relationships

How many instances of one entity will or must be connected to a single instance from the other entities.

### **One-to-One (1:1)**: Each entity instance relates to exactly one instance of another entity

![One-to-One Relationship](</images/database-design/_One-to-One%20Relationship.drawio%20(1).png>)

### **One-to-Many (1:N)**: One entity instance relates to many instances of another entity

![One-to-Many Relationship](/images/database-design/One-to-Many%20Relationship.drawio.png)

### **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: Many instances of one entity relate to many instances of another entity

![Many-to-Many Relationship](</images/database-design/_Many-to-Many%20Relationship.drawio%20(1)%201.png>)

### Participation & Cardinality

**Cardinality**: Specifies the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity.

- Cardinality → Maximum (1 or many)
- Participation → Minimum (0 or 1)

**Total Participation**: Every entity instance must participate in the relationship

**Partial Participation**: Entity instances may or may not participate

![Participation Types](/images/database-design/Participation.drawio%201.png)

## Keys in Database Design

Keys are crucial for maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between tables.

### 1. Primary Key (PK)

Uniquely identifies each record in a table. Cannot be NULL and must be unique.

### 2. Foreign Key (FK)

References the primary key of another table, establishing relationships.

### 3. Composite Key

Combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify a record.

### 4. Candidate Key

Any column or combination of columns that can serve as a primary key.

### 5. Super Key

A set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record (may include unnecessary attributes).

### 6. Alternate Key

Candidate keys that are not chosen as the primary key.

### 7. Surrogate Key

An artificial key used when no natural primary key exists.

## Case Study: Company System

A big company has decided to store information about its projects and employees in a database.

#### Requirements:

- The company has a number of employees; each employee has SSN, Birth Date, Gender and Name which represented as Fname and Lname.
- The company has a set of departments; each department has a set of attributes DName, DNUM (unique) and locations.
- Employees work in several projects; each project has Pname, PNumber as an identifier, Location City.
- Each employee may have a set of dependents; each dependent has Dependent Name (unique), Gender and Birthdate. Note: if the employee left the company no needs to store his dependents info.
- For each Department, there is always one employee assigned to manage that Department and each manager has a hiring Date.
- Department may have employees but employee must work on Only One department.
- Each department may have a set of projects and each project must assigned to one department.
- Employees work in several projects and each project has several employees and each employee has a number of working hours in each project.
- Each employee has a supervisor.
